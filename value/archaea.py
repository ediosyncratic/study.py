"""Archaic and idiosyncratic units of measurement.

See SI.py for base units and units.py for various others.

This file documents lots of obscure and/or silly units, may of them derived from
the /usr/share/misc/units repository of knowledge on the subject (see
units.html, in URLs attribute of this module, for details).  This file aims to
be all-inclusive, rather than sensible; however, there are `issues', since some
of the units (especially ones relevant to trade in the anglophone world) have
several variants - where possible, I have tried to find namespace-based ways to
manage this mess (e.g.: print bushel.US.__doc__), but sometimes (e.g. the chain)
I just gave up and left a comment here indicating the part of the story that
I've left out !

I should probably replace most of this file with a family of XML or RDF
documents describing all the units, coupled to a deployment of some standard
parsing tool-kit to access the data they provide.

There are enough units of measurement here to provide for some cutely specific
units of measurements in all sorts of odd domains.

  For example, consider the fuel efficiency of transport systems fueled by
  petrol; this is commonly measured in miles / gallon in the anglophone world
  (with consequent confusion between the new imperialists and the old; while the
  two agree on what a mile is, they disagree on what a gallon is; five UK
  gallons roughly equal six US gallons) or kilometres / litre in the civilised
  world (48 miles / UK gallon is roughly equal to 40 miles / US gallon and to 17
  kilometres / litre).  This last is, itself, one million times the natural SI
  unit, metres per cubic metre.

  Superficially, this is a 1/area unit, though the implicit `of petrol' clause
  in it does subvert that a little; 17 km/litre is officially 17 million /
  square metre, a.k.a. 17 per square millimetre; which is meaningless drivel
  until I point out that it means that each square millimetre of cross-sectional
  area of your fuel tank contributes (at this fuel efficiency) 17 to the ratio
  between the speed of your vehicle and the rate at which the fuel level in the
  tank is dropping; if your fuel tank's cross-section is one square foot (92,903
  square mm), and your vehicle is managing 17 km/litre, then you're travelling a
  little over one and a half million (i.e. 17 * 92,903) times as fast as the
  level in the fuel tank is dropping.

  In reality, fuel efficiencies of real road vehicles seem to fall in the range
  from around 8 to around 80 mpg (UK), so that a unit of order 20 mpg would be
  quite handy; as it happens, one furlong / UK floz is exactly 20 miles per UK
  gallon, suggesting it as the ideal imperial unit for the task (i.e. it's the
  right size and marvelously perverse).  A slightly saner unit would clearly be
  the mile per UK pint - the given range runs from one to 10 of these, and
  that's a nice range of numbers to work with - which is 2.83 km / litre.  By a
  weird twist of fate, 2.83 is almost exactly the square root of 8; so that the
  civilised unit, one km/litre, is 2.83 miles per UK gallon; and using this unit
  makes the range of real-world values run from 2.8 to 28, with 10 km/litre
  (roughly 28 miles per UK gallon or 23 per US gallon) presenting itself as a
  fairly good cut-off between `inefficient' and `not so bad, all things
  considered'.

  Note that one might equally measure the same phenomenon as a fuel consumption
  rate, in gallons per mile or litres per kilometre, which would encourage
  trying to find a unit of order one UK gallon per 80 miles, a.k.a. one UK pint
  per ten miles or 2 UK floz per mile.  (The pint per mile would also make quite
  a good unit of measurement for pub-crawls, albeit with very different
  semantics.)  A vehicle consuming a small number of floz per mile (up to five
  or six, to match the cut-off above) would then be considered frugal, while
  ones beyond that would be considered wasteful.

Chosing the right unit, and the right way up (c.f. the contrast between fuel
efficiency and consumption rate), is important to how measurements get
interpreted - for example, although the gradient of a sloping road may formally
be a dimensionless quantity, it makes sense to measure `slope' in such units as
metre (of ascent or descent) per kilometre (of travel) or, in a culture which
has different units for vertical and horizontal lengths, fathoms per furlong.
Even when using the official SI unit, different ways of expressing a unit can
change perceptions of its meaning - for example, (metre / second)**2 means the
same as Joule / kilogramme, but expresses a different perspective on it.

  You, in this country, are subjected to the British insularity in weights and
  measures; you use the foot, inch and yard. I am obliged to use that system,
  but must apologize to you for doing so, because it is so inconvenient, and I
  hope Americans will do everything in their power to introduce the French
  metrical system. ... I look upon our English system as a wickedly,
  brain-destroying system of bondage under which we suffer. The reason why we
  continue to use it, is the imaginary difficulty of making a change, and
  nothing else; but I do not think in America that any such difficulty should
  stand in the way of adopting so splendidly useful a reform. -- Lord Kelvin.

In Norway, 10 km is known as 'en mil'.  This is clearly a metricised replacement
for an archaic Norwegian unit of distance, presumably close to the Danish and
Swedish variants which I've found documented on the web.  The name is doubtless
cognate with the Anglic 'mile' (q.v.), but the distance is significantly larger
(but compare the Prussion mile).  The related sj¯mil units of the Scandinavian
tradition literally translate as 'sea mile'; see Swedish.sjoemil, for example.
However, the Scandinavian countries have embraced international standards, so
now use the 1929 nautical mile and the metric system of units, rather than
clinging to archaic units like some less civilized countries.\n""",
