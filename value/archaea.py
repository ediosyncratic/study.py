"""Archaic and idiosyncratic units of measurement.

See SI.py for base units and units.py for various others.

This file documents lots of obscure and/or silly units, many of them derived
from the /usr/share/misc/units repository of knowledge on the subject (see
gnu.org's units.html, in URLs attribute of this module, for details).  This
file aims to be all-inclusive, rather than sensible; however, there are
`issues', since some of the units (especially ones relevant to trade in the
anglophone world) have several variants - where possible, I have tried to find
namespace-based ways to manage this mess (e.g.: print bushel.US.__doc__), but
sometimes (e.g. the chain) I just gave up and left a comment here indicating
the part of the story that I've left out !

I should probably replace most of this file with a family of XML or RDF
documents describing all the units, coupled to a deployment of some standard
parsing tool-kit to access the data they provide.

There are enough units of measurement here to provide for some cutely specific
units of measurements in all sorts of odd domains.

  For example, consider the fuel efficiency of transport systems fueled by
  petrol; this is commonly measured in miles / gallon in the anglophone world
  (with consequent confusion between the new imperialists and the old; while
  the two agree on what a mile is, they disagree on what a gallon is; five UK
  gallons roughly equal six US gallons) or kilometres / litre in the civilised
  world (48 miles / UK gallon is roughly equal to 40 miles / US gallon and to
  17 kilometres / litre).  This last is, itself, one million times the natural
  SI unit, metres per cubic metre.

  Superficially, this is a 1/area unit, though the implicit `of petrol' clause
  in it does subvert that a little; 17 km/litre is officially 17 million /
  square metre, a.k.a. 17 per square millimetre; which is meaningless drivel
  until I point out that it means that each square millimetre of
  cross-sectional area of your fuel tank contributes (at this fuel efficiency)
  17 to the ratio between the speed of your vehicle and the rate at which the
  fuel level in the tank is dropping; if your fuel tank's cross-section is one
  square foot (92,903 square mm), and your vehicle is managing 17 km/litre,
  then you're travelling a little over one and a half million (i.e. 17 *
  92,903) times as fast as the level in the fuel tank is dropping.

  In reality, fuel efficiencies of real road vehicles seem to fall in the
  range from around 8 to around 80 mpg (UK), so that a unit of order 20 mpg
  would be quite handy; as it happens, one furlong / UK floz is exactly 20
  miles per UK gallon, suggesting it as the ideal imperial unit for the task
  (i.e. it's the right size and marvelously perverse).  A slightly saner unit
  would clearly be the mile per UK pint - the given range runs from one to 10
  of these, and that's a nice range of numbers to work with - which is 2.83 km
  / litre.  By a weird twist of fate, 2.83 is almost exactly the square root
  of 8; so that the civilised unit, one km/litre, is 2.83 miles per UK gallon;
  and using this unit makes the range of real-world values run from 2.8 to 28,
  with 10 km/litre (roughly 28 miles per UK gallon or 23 per US gallon)
  presenting itself as a fairly good cut-off between `inefficient' and `not so
  bad, all things considered'.

  Note that one might equally measure the same phenomenon as a fuel
  consumption rate, in gallons per mile or litres per kilometre, which would
  encourage trying to find a unit of order one UK gallon per 80 miles,
  a.k.a. one UK pint per ten miles or 2 UK floz per mile.  (The pint per mile
  would also make quite a good unit of measurement for pub-crawls, albeit with
  very different semantics.)  A vehicle consuming a small number of floz per
  mile (up to five or six, to match the cut-off above) would then be
  considered frugal, while ones beyond that would be considered wasteful.

Chosing the right unit, and the right way up (c.f. the contrast between fuel
efficiency and consumption rate), is important to how measurements get
interpreted - for example, although the gradient of a sloping road may
formally be a dimensionless quantity, it makes sense to measure `slope' in
such units as metre (of ascent or descent) per kilometre (of travel) or, in a
culture which has different units for vertical and horizontal lengths, fathoms
per furlong. Even when using the official SI unit, different ways of
expressing a unit can change perceptions of its meaning - for example, (metre
/ second)**2 means the same as Joule / kilogramme, but expresses a different
perspective on it.

Many units are or have been subject to what amounts to dialect variation, some
have undergone significant changes of definition over time (as compared to the
fine-tuning of, for example, the metre in 1975).  This is only to be expected:
language works like that and it's words we're discussing here.

Comments in the following indicate the views of various sources. (K&L = Kaye
and Laby, NHD = New Hackers' Dictionary, KDWB = Kim's dad's 1936 white
booklet, EB = 11th edition Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911, article on Weights
and Measures.)  The source 'poxy' is my 1973 reprint of the fifth edition of
the Pocket Oxford Dictionary.  Where source is not given in a comment (either
on the line or at start of section) the calculation of the line reflects a
consensus.  Either that or it's some random detail I tripped over somewhere
and jotted down but forgot to record the source ...

Units I describe as `anglophone' are, to the best of my knowledge, common to
all the `English-speaking' peoples (they also typically have equivalents in
archaic units of Scandinavia and sometimes elsewhere): by `imperial' I mean
those in which the US and UK have diverged.  The US versions of these are
collected together in the namespace of an object US; these units also appear
as .US attributes of the (un-namespaced) UK variants.  Various other nations'
arcane units are likewise collected in name-space objects (whose names are
English words for the national adjectives); where cognate with an anglophone
unit, they also appear in that unit's name-space (using the national adjective
in its native tongue, except for French - an attribute name can't have a
cedilla in it).  For these purposes, Troy is treated as a nation - but doesn't
actually mean the ancient city-state of that name !  I should probably do the
same to the UK versions of anglophone units - if only to make this module's
name-space less cluttered !  For similar reasons, I should break up this
module into a sub-package comprising several modules (and probably write some
machinery classes to facilitate cross-linking unit.nation and nation.unit,
among other complications).

This was originally a unit of chemical and thermal energy, defined by Nicolas
ClÈment in 1824 as the amount of energy required to warm one kg of water by
one degree Celsius.  This original 'kg-calorie' definition was superceded just
over a century later when a British Association of Science committee proposed
the 'gram calorie'.  The former is now called the long calorie or Calorie
(capitalised) while the latter is called the short calorie or calorie
(lower-case; try to avoid starting sentences with this word).  Nutritional
information is in many contexts given using the older long Calorie while
modern standards bodies specify calorie to mean diverse variations on the
short calorie; in the resulting confusion, the sanest course of action is to
avoid using these units entirely, especially as they're deprecated by SI
(since they take the heat capacity of water as a unit, without specifying the
temperature at which it's to be taken, despite its variation with
temperature).

Water is at its densest at 4 Celsius and also has its highest heat capacity
there, 4.204 J/K/kg, giving rise to the largest of the range of units known as
the calorie, the 4-degree calorie, measured for a rise from 3.5 to 4.5
Centigrade.  The heat capacity of water decreases, via (4.1855 +/- .0005)
J/K/kg between 14.5 and 15.5 Centigrade, reaching 4.182 J/K/kg between 19.5
and 20.5 Centigrade

See calorie.nutritional, .thermochemical and .international for particular
values selected, from among the available candidates, by standards bodies.
In contrast, calorie.short and .long represent the range of values seen
between 4 and 20 centigrade.

Note that using the Celsius degree (defined as one percent of the interval
between the boiling and freezing temperatures of water) and asking for the
specific heat capacity of water to be 1 (at some suitably specific temperature
and pressure) leads to 64.8 * metre/second as unit of speed; this holds true
regardless of unit of mass, as long as the same unit is used both in building
one's unit of energy and in defining heat capacity (as for the long calorie;
the short calorie uses the kg in defining the Joule but the gram in defining
heat capacity).  Using 64.8 metre (2550 inches, 0.2161 light microseconds) as
unit of length, in conjunction with the second, would suffice, yielding
c. 2720000 cubic metres as unit of volume; a body of water with volume one
millionth of this would thus have mass around 272 kg, which we could use to
complete a system of units based on the second and properties of water.

In Norway, 10 km is known as 'en mil'.  This is clearly a metricised
replacement for an archaic Norwegian unit of distance, presumably close to the
Danish and Swedish variants which I've found documented on the web.  The name
is doubtless cognate with the Anglic 'mile' (q.v.), but the distance is
significantly larger (but compare the Prussion mile).  The related sj¯mil
units of the Scandinavian tradition literally translate as 'sea mile'; see
Swedish.sjoemil, for example, and mile.sea.  However, the Scandinavian
countries have embraced international standards, so now use the 1929 nautical
mile and the metric system of units, rather than clinging to archaic units
like some less civilized countries.
